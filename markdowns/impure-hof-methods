### Avoid impure methods

```javascript
Date (Date.now), Math.random  
```
Since it always produces a new value no matter what the inputs are


```javascript
console.log(), this, global variables, exceptions thrown, etc.
```
In fact, because JavaScript passes object references around, every function that takes an object or array 
is potentially subject to impurity.
