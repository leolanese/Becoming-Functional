> "OOP vs FP: Don't be an FP programmer, don't be an OOP programmer... BE A BETTER PROGRAMMER."

To start with this workshops you need to have an undertanding of what Functional Programming is.
You can check this previous workshop: https://tech.io/playgrounds/0ccbd2817eab67cc4e41211af5c23d1520042/becoming-functional/welcome-



> To become Functional we need to start Thinking Functionally. Lets go throw some steps to get the right mindset into Functional Programming mindset to become into functional.

In a functional program, input flows through a set of functions. Each function operates on its input and produces some output.
Functional style discourages functions with side effects that modify internal state or make other changes that aren’t
visible in the function’s return value. Functions that have no side effects at all are called purely functional.
Avoiding side effects means not using data structures that get updated as a program runs; every function’s
output must only depend on its input.

Its main purpose is to abstract control flow and operations on data with functions in order to avoid
"side effects" and "reduce mutation of state" in your code.

In simple terms, functional programming is a software development style (a way of writing code) like OOP, IP, etc.
that places a major emphasis on the use of functions. FP requires you to think a bit differently about how to
approach the tasks you’re facing. It’s not a matter of just applying functions to come up with a result; the goal,
rather, is to abstract control flows and operations on data with functions in order to avoid side effects and
reduce mutation of state in your application.

FP requires you to think a bit differently about how to approach the tasks you’re facing.

### OK first: In Functional Programming, you don’t just write Pure Functions.

Side effects are good. Functional Languages cannot eliminate Side Effects, they can only confine them. 
The goal instead is to minimize the amount of impure code
