## Becoming functional

Please donâ€™t rush. Learning Functional Programming takes a while. So be patient. This is the second part of the Funtional Programming introduction, and a more practical approach than theory one.

> For a more technical definition or a first approach to Functional Programming please have a look at: (Functional (Programming) Mindset - An introduction to Funtional Programming)[https://tech.io/playgrounds/24002/becoming-functional/introduction]

> You can also have a look at the free GitBook format (Becoming Functional)[https://laneseleo.gitbook.io/workspace/]
