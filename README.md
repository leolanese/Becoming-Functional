## Becoming functional


"Why bother calculating ùúã to 100 places if there‚Äôs no way anyone can read it? To print it out somewhere, we need to write to a console, or send data to a printer, or something where someone can read it. And, what good is a database if you can‚Äôt enter any data into it? We need to read data from input devices, and request information from the network. We can‚Äôt do any of it without side effects. And yet, functional programming is built around pure functions. So how do functional programmers manage to get anything done?

The short answer is, they do what mathematicians do: They cheat." - [James Sinclair](https://jrsinclair.com/)

## ACTIONS

<br />
Here there is a list of <b>Actions</b> that we can consider to have in mind if we want to get into Functional Programming.
Please don't rush. Take your time. <br/>
Learning FP sometimes is a bit cryptic and code looks weird in the beginning. Learning Functional Programming takes a while to master it and some other times we need to stop doing what we used to do and try a different way of doing the same thing, pushing ourselves out of the comfortable zone. So, please be patient and open your mind.¬†<br/>
<br />
This is the second part of the Functional Programming introduction and a more practical approach than theory one. For the first approach to Functional Programming please have a look at [Functional (Programming) Mindset - An introduction to Functional Programming](https://tech.io/playgrounds/24002/becoming-functional/introduction)
